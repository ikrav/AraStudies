singleton.cc - takes an ARA datafile with many events and saves a single event 
    af the given index into a separate file.

    INPUT: Index of target event, path of source file, path of output file. Source 
    file is assumed to contain a TTree named 'eventTree' which, in turn, is expected 
    to contain a branch named 'event'. Index must be an integer and must be within the 
    bounds of 'eventTree'. The entries in the source tree must be of type RawAtriStationEvent*.

    OUTPUT: File containing only the target event. Output will be formatted as a TTree named
    'eventTree' and will contain a branch named 'event'.

    E.g. place the fourth event (index 3) in "old.root" into a singleton file "new.root"...

      root [0] .x singleton.cc(3, "old.root", "new.root")

    WARNING: All arguments are assumed to be valid. Invalid arguments will *not* be caught before
    reaching the ROOT API and will result in undefined behavior.

    The script loads the libAraEvent.so from the AraRoot libraries location.
